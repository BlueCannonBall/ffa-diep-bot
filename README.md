# ffa-diep-bot
A simple diep.io autoplay bot based on puppeteer.

The bot only functions properly in ffa-like gamemodes, such as sandbox, maze, and ffa. The bot can also only farm squares, and has trouble fighting spam tanks.

# Usage

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. If you get any errors, try deleting package-lock.json. To use the bot, run `node bot.js`.
